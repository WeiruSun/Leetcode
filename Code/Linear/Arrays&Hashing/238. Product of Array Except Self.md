# question

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

# solution
the input and output are both list. And could not use division. 

- define a list
- count prefix and store in that list
- then from the end of given list, calculate postfix of given list and multiply with prefix.  
```
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = [1] * (len(nums))
        
        #count prefix
        prefix = 1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            res [i] = prefix
            prefix = prefix * nums[i]
        
        postfix = 1
        for i in range(len(nums) -1,-1,-1):
            res [i] = postfix * res[i]
            postfix = postfix * nums[i]
        return res
```

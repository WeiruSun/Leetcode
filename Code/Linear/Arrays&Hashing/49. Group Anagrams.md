# question
Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.


Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]

Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

solution:
required output is a list contains lists


# solution1:
use dictionary

- iterate the strs first

- sort the string and use sorted string as keys,append unsorted string as values

- then put the values of hashset in a list. 

```
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        dic = defaultdict(list)
        for string in strs:
            key = ''.join(sorted(string))
            dic[key].append(string)

        return list(dic.values())
```

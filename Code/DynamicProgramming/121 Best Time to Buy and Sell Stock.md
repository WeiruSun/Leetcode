    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(prices)
        if n == 0 or n == 1:
            return 0
        
        dp = [[0 for i in range(2)]for j in range(n)]
        dp[0][1] = -prices[0]
        for i in range(1,n):
            dp[i][0] = max(dp[i-1][0],dp[i-1][1] + prices[i])
            dp[i][1] = max(dp[i-1][1],-prices[i])
        return dp[n-1][0]

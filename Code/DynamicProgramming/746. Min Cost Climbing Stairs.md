# question

## brute force solution 
By using decision tree, the height = n, and we can have two branches for every single node, so time complexity would be 2**n


## dp : bottom-up solution
solve the problem right to left. To arrive index x, what is the minimum cost. 

time complexity : O(n)
 ```Python
 class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        cost.append(0)
        #update the cost of each position to the minimum cost of getting to the destination
        for i in range(len(cost)-3,-1,-1):
            cost[i] += min(cost[i+1],cost[i+2])

        return min(cost[0],cost[1])
```

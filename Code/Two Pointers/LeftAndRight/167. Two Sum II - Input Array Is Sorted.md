```Python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        left = 0
        right = len(numbers)-1
        
        while left < right:
            current = numbers[left] +numbers[right]
        
            if current >target:
                right -= 1
            
            elif current < target:
                left += 1
            
            else:
                return (left+1, right+1)
             
```

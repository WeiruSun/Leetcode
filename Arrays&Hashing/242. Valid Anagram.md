# Valid Anagram

Description: Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

data structure been used:
use the dictionary and the dict.get(<get>, valueA) where valueA is the value to be return when the key is not found
```
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) == len(t):
            countS = {}
            countT = {}
            for i in range(len(s)):
                countS[s[i]] = 1+ countS.get(s[i],0)
                countT[t[i]] = 1+ countT.get(t[i],0)
            return countS == countT
        
        else: return False

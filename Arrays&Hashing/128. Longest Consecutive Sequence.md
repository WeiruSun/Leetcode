# question

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.


#solution

- If sort the array, the complexity would be O(nlogn)
- The question is to find the length of the longest sequence. 
  - So to find the start point of a sequence. We can make the array a set, then see if any left number of current number exists in that set.
  - then check if the next number of the start exists in the sequence

class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) == 0:
            return 0
        numSet = set(nums)
        longest = 0

        for n in nums:
            if (n-1) not in numSet:
                length = 1
                while (n+length) in numSet:
                    length +=1
                longest = max(longest,length)  
        
        return longest
```

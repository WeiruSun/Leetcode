## solution 1
start from the index i, how many ways we can decode the remaining portion of the string, dimension of the cache would be n. 

Each time we are at one position,at most we have two decision to make => O(1)

time complexity : O(n)


### base case
s = "121"

dp[i] = dp[i+1] + dp[i+2]

```Python
class Solution:
    def numDecodings(self, s: str) -> int:
        dp = { len(s):1}

        def dfs(i):
            if i in dp:
                return dp[i]
            if s[i] == "0":
                return 0

            res = dfs(i+1)
            #check if two-digit value in range(10,26)
            if (i + 1 < len(s) and (s[i] == "1" or s[i] == "2" and s[i+1] in "0123456")):
                res += dfs(i+2)

            dp[i] = res

            return res

        return dfs(0)
```

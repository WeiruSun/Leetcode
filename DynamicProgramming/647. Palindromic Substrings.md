## solution 1: brute force - find each substring start with current character

GO through every single substring, we have n**2 substring

determining that a string is a palindrome is O(n)

time complexity : O(N**3)


## solution 2 : find each substring that current character is the middle of the substring

start at every single position and potentially expanding the outwards all the way to the end of the string. 0(N)
time complexity : O(N**2)

```Python
class Solution:
    def countSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        res = 0

        for i in range(len(s)):
            res += self.countPali(s,i,i)
            res += self.countPali(s,i,i+1)
           
        return res
    
    def countPali(self,s,l,r):
        res =0
        while l >=0 and r < len(s) and s[l] == s[r]:
                res +=1
                l-=1
                r+=1
        return res
```

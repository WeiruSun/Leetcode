# question

You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.


solution 1:
- how to choose the character to be replaced?
 find the most frequent element in the slicing window and calculate left element number by windowlen - countB, then compare with k. 
- how to replace the character?
    does not need to replace the character. 

```
class Solution(object):
    def characterReplacement(self, s, k):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        l = 0
        res = 0
        count = {}
        maxF = 0

        for r in range(len(s)):
            count[s[r]] = 1 + count.get(s[r],0)
            maxF = max(maxF,count[s[r]])

            if (r-l+1) - maxF > k:
                count[s[l]] -=1
                l+= 1

            res = max(res, r-l+1)
        return res


```

判断是否有环 Detect Cycles with a HashSet

```Python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        slow,fast = n,self.getNext(n)
        while fast !=1 and slow != fast:
            slow = self.getNext(slow)
            fast = self.getNext(self.getNext(fast))
        return fast==1
        

    def getNext(self,n):
        total_sum = 0
        while n > 0:
            n, digit = divmod(n, 10)
            total_sum += digit ** 2
        return total_sum
```

**Time complexity : O(243⋅3+logn+loglogn+logloglogn)... = O(logn).**

Finding the next value for a given number has a cost of O(logn) because we are processing each digit in the number, and the number of digits in a number is given by logn.

#Solution

1. use fast and slow pointer to find the middle of the linked list
2. cut the list into first part and second part
3. reverse the second part
4. merge the two part 

```Python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.
        """
        current = head
        slow,fast = head, head.next

        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        
        second = slow.next
        prev = slow.next = None
        while second:
            temp = second.next
            second.next = prev
            prev = second
            second = temp

        #merge two half
        first,second = head,prev
        while second:
            temp1,temp2 = first.next,second.next
            first.next = second
            second.next = temp1
            first,second = temp1,temp2    
```

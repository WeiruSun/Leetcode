# question

Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.


# solution:
1. how to check if the minimum height min(height) * len(height) is not max square?
2. how to continue calculating the area?


if the heights is not in increasing order, it would be popped


```Python
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(heights) == 0:
            return 0
        
        stack = []
        res = 0
        for i,h in enumerate(heights):
            start = i
            while stack and stack[-1][1] > h:
                index, height = stack.pop()
                res = max(res,height * (i-index))
                start = index
            stack.append((start,h))

        for i,h in stack:
            res = max(res, h * (len(heights)-i))
        return res
```

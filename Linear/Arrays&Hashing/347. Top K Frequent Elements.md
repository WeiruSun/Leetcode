# question
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2

Output: [1,2]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1], k = 1

Output: [1]

#solution 1
- Create an empty heap
- Create a map to keep track of the frequency of each element in the array
- Iterate over the array and for each element, increment its frequency in the map
- Iterate over the map and for each element, add it to the heap with its frequency as the key
- The top k elements in the heap are the k most frequent elements in the array.
```
```

# solution 2
use bucket sort, frequency as keys and numbers as values(list).
```python
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:

        if len(nums) == k:
            return nums

        dic = {}

        freq = [[]for i in range(len(nums)+1)]

        for number in nums:
            dic[number] = 1 + dic.get(number,0)
        
        for n, c in dic.items():
            freq[c].append(n)

        res = []
        for i in range(len(freq)-1,0,-1):
            for n in freq[i]:
                res.append(n)
                if len(res) == k:
                    return res 
```

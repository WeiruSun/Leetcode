```Python
from collections import Counter
class Solution:
    def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:
        source = Counter(magazine)
        generated = Counter(ransomNote)

        for i in range(len(ransomNote)):
            if source[ransomNote[i]] < generated[ransomNote[i]]:
                return False
        
        return True
```
**Time complexity**
m is the length of the magazine, and nnn is the length of the ransom note
The basic HashMap operations, get(...) and put(...), are O(1) time complexity.

Time Complexity : O(m).

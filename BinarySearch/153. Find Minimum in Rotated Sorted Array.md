# question

Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

```Python
class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        start,end = 0, len(nums)-1
        current = float("inf")

        while start < end:
            mid = (end-start)//2 + start
            current = min(current,nums[mid])

            if nums[mid] > nums[end]:
                start = mid +1
            else:
                end = mid -1
        return min(current,nums[start])

```
